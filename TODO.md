# TODO

* (2) upcome costs (some buildings, all military)
    * if too low income for upcome costs: soldiers slowly run away, buildings will get abandoned
* (6) MILIATRY: attack target: { wildlings, the empire }
* (4) ! MILIATRY: getting attacked end of turn
* (2) gausche glocken kurve research+einbauen, see KRand

# UP NEXT

* (3) + TRADE: je mehr buy, desto teurer wirds, mit cooldown; vice versa sell
* when attack won, there should be at least some loot, but never 0
