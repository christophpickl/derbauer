# Happenings

## Examples

* gold bag/treasure: +gold
* rats eaten: -food
* heritage: +gold (+building/land)
* plague: -people!!!
* someone visits: traveler/magician ... can be good/bad ...
    * tells a secret: get free upgrade

    * storm: -food, -people, -building
* armies join: +army
* marriage / birth => if dies (because of age) option to continue by day 1 but with same state
* immigrants: if happyness (and karma) is high, free people move in

## Effects

* +/- resource/building/upgrade/army
* +/- resource prod

## Ideas

* increase likelyhood of rats if: lots of food, no buildings/upgrades which protect from it + eaten amount depends on amount of stored food
* ? happenings mit selber viel choices (wie action game)
    - happenings auch waehrend dem turn (evtl durch action triggered)
    - oder einfach random wenn im menue rumklicken
    - OR: are happenings always PASSIVE only?!?
* long lasting happenings
    - e.g.: blessing from farm good increases farm productivity for X turns
    - affects: income, prod, efficiency, military
* when land is lost, building(s) will be destroyed if not enough free land
* reisender gibt schriftrolle fuer free upgrade
* new happening: random people/army join; make happening#condition() .. check whether player good capacity/necessary features
- people die (murder/crime/krankheit)
- free food
- some people/armies join
