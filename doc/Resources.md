# Types

1. Food
    * production, capacity, trade, capacity
    * mainly by buildings (prod/cap)
    * if over limit, then lose gradually
    * get via random events (happenings) depending on karma (and amount on wealth)
    * income influenced by upgrades/features/achievements
1. Gold
    * (maybe?) production (via mines)
    * mainly via people (tax rate)
        - modifiers: number of people + happyness
        - via buildings (mines change modifier, maybe static production?)
        - wealth "somehow" is relevant
    * upcome costs
    * get via random events (happenings) depending on karma (and amount on wealth)
    * income influenced by upgrades/features/achievements
    * it's not possible to get negative balance (only if contract exists with bank)
        - if in minus (without bank contract): in end turn resources/buildings immediately gone until in positive again
1. People
    * capacity, used (for buildings, kind of "upcome"??)
    * happyness: do something "nice" for people
    * reproduce themselves via production rate (depends on happyness and food availability)
    * spent for armies
    * might trade via slavery upgrade (less happyness)
    * get via random events (happenings) depending on karma (and amount on wealth)
        - imigrants move in (if happy, enough housing, enough food)
    * income influenced by upgrades/features/achievements
    * if over limit, then lose gradually
1. Land
    * trade (only later via special upgrade, highly expensive)
    * used for buildings

* in earl stage of game, food is the main thing
    - later on, gold
    - later later on, land as buildings require lots of land
    - push user to get more involved in military actions (as trading is highly expensive)
