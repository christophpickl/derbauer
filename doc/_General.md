# Core Values

* "esoterische perspektive" => alles hat auswirkung aufeinander, jede entscheidung hat eine auswirkung
* "weniger ist mehr" => konzepte (zum player hin sichtbare) gering halten, wenig auswahl, logik dahinter komplex

# Motivator

* build shiny castle (a la civilisation), something "for the eye"
* marry + birth => 2nd round (a la fugger)
* discover/enable new features (build, army, actions, minigames,...)
* beat highscore

# Randomness

* send input through "machine" to get random-like output value
* cooldowns
* make it all "fuzzier" (unpredictable)
* season depending: only during winter/summer (some days)
