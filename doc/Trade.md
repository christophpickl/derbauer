# Trade

* only limited amount of resources to buy
* price changes for each interaction
    - buying much: higher buy price
    - selling much: lower sell price

# Tradable stuff

* food
    - very poor sell
* land
    - very expensive, buy/sell dif not that big
* armies
    - high requirements (buildings, upgrades, achievements)
    - very expensive

## Ideas

* trade is related to the term "marketplace" (a new building?!)
    - faster "regeneration" (more to buy/sell)
    - better prices (far not as much as achievement though)
